Abstract
The goal of the current project is to conduct a participatory research study designed to capture the authentic and holistic picture of the disability experience for the goal of creating a more authentic disability awareness training paradigm. Previous research on disability awareness tools has found mixed results. Some studies have suggested favourable outcomes of simulation techniques on awareness levels (Herbert, 2000), while others have reported a subsequent increase in stigma, embarrassment, and social exclusion (French, 1992; Nario-Redmond et al., 2017). Perhaps one reason for the failings of these prior approaches is that they were often developed without the direct input of people living with a disability. To address this limitation, we utilized a participatory research method whereby those with a lived experience disability were surveyed and interviewed to identify the limitations of existing awareness tools and determine what comprises an effective disability awareness training paradigm. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to determine the recurring patterns and key themes in our data. Qualitative results and their implication for research and training are discussed. By allowing participants to share their subjective and objective experiences, we sought to gain a holistic understanding of their experiences that will inform the development of future disability awareness tools.
